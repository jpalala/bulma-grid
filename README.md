# Bulma-Grid

This is v.0.9.3 of the bulma grid scss file only.

You can install by doing `npm i --save bulma-grid` then referencing the bulma.scss file into your project.

## Forked from j1mc/bulma-scss

[Bulma-scss](https://github.com/j1mc/bulma-scss): This is a port of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) project SASS files to the
SCSS syntax.

Currently, these files are based on Bulma version 0.9.3, and will be updated
with later releases. The files are converted to SCSS with
[this script](https://gist.github.com/j1mc/ff1ff83e277b1e221761fc0c0ee3b164).
